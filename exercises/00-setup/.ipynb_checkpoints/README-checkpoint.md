# Setup


For most parts of the course, such as the project, it will be more necessary to have a local environment set up for Jupyter Lab (see point 3. below). Moreover, it can be very useful to set this up for any future projects you may have in other classes. We've created an easy to follow guide, and you are required to complete this tutorial. However, if you are facing issues in setting up locally, please use a cloud-based environment to complete the exercises every week until you have sucessfuly setup your local environment.

Our recommended cloud-based environment would be EPFL Noto, if you are having issues with your local setup. These cloud-based environments are convenient as they don't require an extensive local setup. You can find a tutorial on Noto **[here: `noto.md`](noto.md)**. 

## Local setup + Jupyter guides

This tutorial is designed to get you up and running with Git and your local Python environment, and give you the basics of Jupyter notebooks. Make sure you can open an exercise using Noto (see above) before getting your local environment ready.

It is composed of 3 parts:

- **[1. Git & GitHub](git.md)**
- **[2. Local Python environment](python_env.md)**
- **[3. Jupyter Notebooks & Jupyter Lab](jupyter.md)**


**To check that your environment can be used for the exercises, run the [`check_setup.ipynb` notebook](check_setup.ipynb).**
